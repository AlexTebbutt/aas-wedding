		        <p>Here's where our story begins... Before we could even think about the wedding in Mauritius, we had to be legally married first.</p>
		        
		        <p>We decided to keep it small, after all there were going to be three weddings so best not to jump the gun from the get go.</p>
		        
		        <p>The ceremony was held at the Chelsea Registry Office on a perfect Friday afternoon on the 8<sup>th</sup> August 2014, at 3:30pm.</p>
