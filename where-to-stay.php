					<h1>Places to stay</h1>
					
					<p>Hadleigh is a small town and only has one hotel and a few pubs and guest houses. There are, however, many lovely little villages with places to stay and also the larger towns of Ipswich and Colchester just down the road with some of the hotel chains</p>
					
					<p>We've put together a list of local places below and you can google <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=accommodation+hadleigh+suffolk" target="_blank">Accommodation Hadleigh Suffolk</a> for further ideas.</p>
