						<h2>Getting there</h2>
						
						<h3>By Car</h3>
						
						<p>Hadleigh is located in the county of Suffolk between the two large towns of Colchester and Ipswich.</p>
						
						<p><strong>From London / The West</strong></p>
						
						<p>The quickest route is to get to the A12 from M25, junction xx. The turn off you need is sign posted for Hadleigh and East Bergholt and is approx. 8 miles after you pass Colchester.</p>
						
						<p><strong>From the East</strong></p>
						
						<p>Follow the A12 from Ipswich and, approx. 5 miles down the road, take the Hadleigh and East Bergholt turnoff.<p>
							
						<p><strong>Once you've taken the turn off</strong></p>				
						
						<p>Once on the road follow the signs for Hadleigh, there are very few junctions so you should be ok. This will bring you to Bentley Street (you'll know you're there because it's a very narrow street) at the back of Hadleigh. Follow the high street all the way to the end and round the bend to the right. If you get to the bridge over the river you're heading in the right direction and you're almost there!</p>
						
						<p>Shortly after the bridge you'll past the borough council offices and get to the cricket pitch on you're left, just around the corner there is a left had turn onto Coram Street. Take this and follow the road up the hill for 1.5 miles. The Barley House is in the very last group of houses on your left before you get to the t-junction.</p>
						
						<h3>By Train</h3>
						
						<p>The nearest towns with train stations are Colchester Main line (approx. 25 minutes by car) and Ipswich Town (approx. 20 mins by car)</p>
						
						<p>From London trains leave extremely regularly from Liverpool street and cost from £12 each way if you book in advance</p>
						
						<p><strong>Cabs</strong></p>
						
						<p>There are cabs available at the train stations but we'd recommend booking a cab, we've put a few numbers for each station below</p>
